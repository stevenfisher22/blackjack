Simple Blackjack app built as an assignment to learn JavaScript and DOM manipulation. 

After stopping progress on the app once I had the basics of the deck, shuffle, and deal/hit/stay buttons I returned to finish the functionality utilizing jQuery. 

The game is still a work in progress. I need to update the dealer's hole card to not show until the player has stayed. I also need to add a function to handle the Ace's points to account for 1 or 11 as I initially built it to be only 1 for ease of learning.
